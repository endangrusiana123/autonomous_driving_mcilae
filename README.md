# Autonomous Driving MCILAE  
### Multimodal Conditional Imitation Learning with Attention & Error Compensation  
*Implementation for CARLA 0.9.15 (UE4.26)*

---

## 📌 Overview  
This repository contains the complete source code used for developing and evaluating  
**Multimodal Conditional Imitation Learning with Attention and Error Compensation (MCILAE)**  
for end-to-end autonomous driving in the CARLA simulator.

The project extends the baseline CIL and MCIL architectures by integrating:

- **Multimodal RGB–Depth fusion**
- **Attention refinement (CBAM)**
- **Longitudinal feedback correction (Error Compensation)**
- **Throttle-phase-aware dataset design**
- **Robust evaluation under multiple towns, weathers, and dynamic traffic**

This implementation supports full dataset logging, training, validation, testing,  
and visualization inside CARLA 0.9.15.
